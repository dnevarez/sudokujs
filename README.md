Sudoku Puzzle
=============

A Javascript implementation of Sudoku, including a backtracking algorithm solver.

Based off walkthrough at http://moriel.smarterthanthat.com/contact/ by Moriel Schottlender.

Future edits to create a game generator, rather than simply a blank Sudoku board.

Possible adaptations to javascript frameworks.
